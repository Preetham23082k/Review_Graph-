I do really recommend this place- Staff si high qualified, Kind and really helpful- Animation staff get You involved, but always with discrection - Miniclub si super and activities offered are interesting and smart- Rooms clean, with AC and balcony- Restaurant offers a great selection of food - always. The beach si extremly closed to the hotel - Miniclub area offers some gazebos to have shade for kids- A lot of bicycles are available for free- I am completely satisfied of this hotel- Go in lime this!",5
Hotel_Review-g194775-d1121769-Reviews-Hotel_Baltic-Giulianova_Province_of_Teramo_Abruzzo.html,"I visited Hotel Baltic with my husband for some bike riding in the area, thinking it would just be another hotel. I was so wrong. We don't have children, but were so amazed at the attention to detail and kindness we experienced from every member of the staff. It was truly amazing.",5
Hotel_Review-g194775-d1121769-Reviews-Hotel_Baltic-Giulianova_Province_of_Teramo_Abruzzo.html,"I've travelled quite a numbers of hotels but this is the best place you can achieve with an excellent ratio quality/money. The equipe is really excellent. The restaurant's staff and the chef are perfect. Menu is always varying. Bar service is really fantastic. On the beach rather than in the hotel, anything is perfect and our holiday went like a dream. Although prices could seems quite high, you must consider that you could even forget your wollet at home. You'll never be required to spend any money. Kids are always happy and miniclub staff is really efficient. My daughter crying for our leaving could explain better what I'm writing.",5
Hotel_Review-g194775-d1121769-Reviews-Hotel_Baltic-Giulianova_Province_of_Teramo_Abruzzo.html,"We decided for this family holiday destination after we saw its ranking in the family hotel 2013 reviews. It has kept its promises. Plus: - all staff is extremely kind and willing to help you at any time - great attention to the confort of kids - private playground in front of the hotel in a pinery providing shade all day long - great breakfast - beach umbrella and deck chairs assigned to guests on the beach right in front of the hotel - great kids menu also during weaning - lots of activities for kids (and parents as well, if you wish so) - free baby club for 1-3 years old - swimming pool with children's corner (not big but works fine) - it feels like being home - two gazebo on the beach used for the mini-clubs - massages available all day long ( not spa) - beach towels provided Minus (because perfection is impossible) - restaurant tends to be a bit slow - beach gazebo for the bigger kids a bit too small in the midday sun Just a couple of notes: - if you don't mind the first floor you can avoid the elevators (at peak times there's some queing up to do) - booking is a bit messy, better to double check to make sure everything's fine - if your bed is unconfortable you can try and get it changed, if we had known it before we would have done so Overall a great time! It would deserve 4 stars from a service perspective.",4
Hotel_Review-g194775-d1121769-Reviews-Hotel_Baltic-Giulianova_Province_of_Teramo_Abruzzo.html,"Great customer service and good restaurant service is what made this experience so wonderful for my family. Giulianuova is a pretty simple , not so ""wow"" town, with not very clean beaches as I was expecting when booking my reservation. What saved my vacation was staying at Baltic. Baltic is a very simple but functional hotel, but what makes it so special are the people that work there. It seems that as a part of their job training they had take some kind of class on humanity and spirituality, because the way they treat every single person with respect and smile is just amazing. Good job to the manager Massimo (who knows how to hire great people)!",4

Not much English is spoken by the staff (thankful for Google translate)! Breakfast was good selection overlooking the garden. The room was comfortable, clean and spacious. With the hotel being surrounded by nature there were a lot of mosquitoes :( It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the centre of town.

Breakfast was very good and the rooms have lots of space. Very clean and comfortable. One problem was lots of mosquitos even in our room. I think this is a paraty problem rather than hotel problem but the room lacked a mosquito net and we where bitten all over. Shower was nice and warm. Location is just out of town. 10min walk and the hotel will provide a map. Overall a nice place and good stay,4

To keep it short, we loved the stay and would come again. The highlights include: 1. Monkeys! They have super cute monkeys (small ones, the size of a cat) leaving on the trees, everyone loved them! 2. The rooms are perfectly clean and have a lot of character. 3. The breakfast was really really nice 4. The staff was very helpful 5. Overall, it was nice and relaxing. On the negative side: 1. Wi-Fi had issues 2. It's about 25 mins walk to the Old Town. It's good, because it's quiet and parking is easy, but it's a personal preference. 3. The rooms open up into the courtyard, so if you want to sleep late, you may get woken up by guests eating breakfast. It didn't bother us and we had great sleep. Overall, we loved it.",5

The place is outside the city centre, about 20 minute walk into town. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but not luxurious. The breakfast was ok, a lot to choose from. The staff was the best asset, very friendly and accommodating. I had dinner there one night and the food was excellent. One kid who worked there spoke, French, Spanish and English. But I think he only works there during the school vacation... no one else spoke English. I would stay there again",4

The main river passes just behind, my suggestion is the boat ride that starts from inside the inn and reaches the sea. Just minutes from the historic center, you can enjoy the nature and the city. The restaurant is excellent, my tip is to order the grilled stingray with a glass of wine.",5

Hotel_Review-g644280-d1821178-Reviews-Agriturismi_Il_Castello_La_Grancia-Pienza_Tuscany.html,"Agriturismo La Grancia is a room rentals structure in Spedaletto in the same compound of Agriturismo Spedaletto which is a complex including a 1300 Castle just a separate management. The Grancia rooms are those in the building on the left as soon as you enter the complex, and includes rooms on the ground floor and 1st floor, a common kitchenette where you can make your own coffee or tea and store your stuff in the Frigidaire (but you cannot cook), a common area with a large table and chairs and WiFi is free and worked perfectly. The room was on the ground floor, it was large and comfortable with window opening on a private seating area outside. Cotto stone floors and high ceiling with wooden beams. No safebox in our room so keep note of it. TIP: You are in the countryside, it is normal to find some bugs here and there, the outside premises is full of plants and flowers therefore there are mosquitoes and bees so if you get bitten I suggest to bring mosquitoes repellants it will be very helpful. The breakfast is served in a lovely large room on a long table in a different structure you walk to. Homemade cakes made by the lovely owner Cinzia who makes also nice fresh eggs taken from her own chickens. She will prepare your cappuccino and eggs and you will also enjoy local cured meats,tomatoes, toasted bread cheese and more. To makes it clear for other guests this is not an Hotel but more of a room rental, Cinzia will go over and beyond to accommodate you but keep in mind you have to be organized because you are in the middle of nowhere so plan accordingly. Also, you will need a car to get to this area, no way around without . There is a small restaurant open at lunch only in the compound . The whole complex is very cute there is a lot of green, a bio lake where you can bathe in but has to follow the rules because it is a natural pond with plants and you have to shower before getting in and not use sunscreen or lotions you may compromise the waters and the plants. There is plenty of space to walk, lounge chairs and little cute gazebos to relax. Cinzia the owner and her daughter Alice are exquisite women very friendly and open minded. The structure has also an adjacent mill where you can buy homemade products. The major attractions are close by: Pienza is very close as well as Bagno Vignoni and San Quirico D’Orcia and you can also reach Montalcino and other small famous towns. Thank you Cinzia !",5

Your Mother is so amazing at running the breakfast buffet, the food was so delicious. Your Nonna’s baking also was incredible. The Castle & grounds were kept meticulously. We stayed in the Molino building & our room was on top floor. It was big & beautifully done & with a Gorgeous view. We got to relaxed at local hot springs and enjoyed exploring nearby Monteriggioni, Monticchiello & Montepulciano. Just the perfect location! Than you so much,,,",5

This castle, built along the Francigena or pilgrim road, was built by priest Ugolino da Rocchione as a fortified farm and a place to host pilgrims on their journey. It sits in a quiet rural setting with scenic views of the beautiful Orcia Valley. You can book rooms with breakfast included in this lovely restored castle! Wish we had been able to. If we return we surely will!",4

Lovely accomodation in a very unusual setting. Full marks to the lovely owners for renovating parts for the purpose of tourism and providing such an experience. Great breakfast spread in a basement room which got us fuelled up for hectic days of driving. Stay here for the experience and very reasonable tariff,5

Cynthia was sweet and kind and spoiled us. Breakfast was simply amazing, tomatoes from the garden, local Tuscan cheeses and meats. And beautiful cakes, fruit, yogurt, eggs and great cappuccinos and tea. Access to a kitchen made it even more pleasant. Excellent location for visiting Tuscany. Easy access to the main roads and Pienza, Montalcino, San Quirico, and Montepulciano.",5
Hotel_Review-g644280-d1821178-Reviews-Agriturismi_Il_Castello_La_Grancia-Pienza_Tuscany.html,"I must start from the fact that it is a real castle. Out of discussion – real castle standing in the fields not far from Pienza. If you plan to explore Val d’Orcia I can strongly recommend you to choose this location. Of course highway is +/- 40 minutes away from this place but it is a perfect spot to enjoy the countryside for couple of days Montalcino and Montepulciano are really close to Spedaletto. Environment is nice, owners take care of area and you clearly see it at first sight. It is necessary to say a few words about bio-lake located on the territory – is a kind of pool (merely cold one) but without chemicals and more close to nature. There are some sunbeds, sun chairs and umbrellas near this bio-lake and you could enjoy some hours of sunny morning with the book relaxing with the view to hills and field nearby. The room is big enough, with comfy bed and renovated bathroom so you can feel like in a normal hotel inside the ancient castle with long history. This feeling is really amazing and impressive, I am glad to have this experience and could recommend it to all friends. The minor point is that the owner does not speak a word in English as I would like to discuss something but it is impossible. NO word at all, get ready to explain something with your hands and feet. There is one speaking person, the daughter of the owner but she is not always available and so normally you’d better speak Italian, this would help. Breakfast room is on the ground floor and you can’t reach it from inside so must pass the street but it is not a big deal. The choice of food for breakfast is not wide, I would expect to see more local and farm products but reality is different. Even cakes are not home-made, strange for such a place but nothing to do with it – may be this could be a point to improve in future. There is no restaurant for lunch and dinner and so you would have to drive to some village nearby to go to the restaurant – not always convenient, especially for wine tasting region… I was worried about the wi-fi signal quality because of thick castle walls but in fact it was not a problem, you have good connection in the room but practically no connection in the breakfast room (may be this was done on purpose – so that gest leave the breakfast faster ;-) ). Parking is available free of charge. I can recommend this hotel for everyone visiting Tuscany and hope to come back one day.",4
Hotel_Review-g644280-d1821178-Reviews-Agriturismi_Il_Castello_La_Grancia-Pienza_Tuscany.html,"This eco-friendly agriturismo is simply astonishing: you stay in a real old castle with modern amenities. Cinzia, the owner, is extremely helpful and active in making you very comfortable since your arrival. Breakfast is rich and served in the grand room by the unstoppable Cinzia. You will find yourself surrounded by beautiful gardens where you can take a stroll or sit at the outside tables among roses and geraniums drinking local wine produced by the property's owner. You can also take a sun bath (and immerse yourself in) at the ""bio-lake"" pool. One important note: do NOT confuse this amazing place with the neighbor's agriturismo (which uses in a misleading way the word 'castel' in its title, but you do not get a room in the castle and with no bio-lake pool and other facilities). Make sure that you make the reservation at La Grancia castel of Spedaletto. I will definitely be back here soon.",5

Castle rooms are lovely but maybe could do with slightly fewer frilly cushions :-). Excellent location for the Val d'Orcia, Montepulciano, Montalcino etc. Bio-pool is great for an afternoon swim. Lovely breakfast, and would have given 5 out of 5 if there had been the opportunity to eat evening meals at the property, rather than having to drive (admittedly a very short distance) to nearby restaurants.",4

Stayed in the main building in a room named Panorama which shared common space with three other rooms. Rooms just large enough, nice bathroom, great view of the countryside. Too cold to use many outside amenities but one can see the outdoors will be great with warmer weather. Breakfast was good with variety and typically Tuscan. There is an out-building which, while very nice, didn’t have that “in the castle” feel. We would try to only stay in the castle rooms. Part of the beautiful Val d'Orcia on the way from Pienza to Bagno Vignoni and Montalcino.",4

We asked to be moved to the actual castle the next day and they obliged. The whole place is so romantic with fantastic views over the countryside and beautiful gardens and landscape throughout. Breakfast is plentiful and served by the friendly hostesses who although can't speak too much English tried their best to make us feel welcome. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely love to return one day. When we checked out, the lovely hostess gave us a bottle of wine to take with us to our next destination! How very sweet.",5
Hotel_Review-g644280-d1821178-Reviews-Agriturismi_Il_Castello_La_Grancia-Pienza_Tuscany.html,"From the moment I saw the castle from the road, I knew I would have a special time in this agriturismo. It all started with some phone calls in which I talked with the owner about the time of my arrival for the check-in, communication was no problem and everything was easy to set up. I sent previously an email but I got no answer: I don't think they check emails that often. The castle is bigger than I expected, definitely imposing with its two towers. It dates back to at least 1236AD, a History lover like me could not miss a stay in a place like this! There are only seven rooms so it never felt crowded. My room, ""Torretta"", had a big communal space with cool old furniture with other two rooms: it's possible to prepare tea there. The room itself was spacious too: it had a corridor, a big bathroom with shower (rather new), a very comfortable bed, two couches and a small table: everything was deliciously set up. It felt VERY romantic! The gardens around the castle are lovely: there are roses all around, leading to the bio pool; around it some recliners where to relax. Beyond the gardens, only the cultivated fields for which Val d'Orcia is famous, with the Monte Amiata in the background: beautiful, stunning landscape! Quality of sleep is excellent: there is hardly any sound coming from the outside (if you don't take into account the call coming from the chicken coop in the morning!), the bed isn't noisy at all (I hate squeaky beds) and the two pillows given are of different kind, one softer and the other a bit thicker: great to have a choice on that too! Wifi is present and free of charge: not extremely fast, but reliable. The room felt hot the first day, but opening the windows was enough. A/C was present but to cool down such a big room take some time. Even if I was a bit prepared as I saw the pictures, in the morning I had the best moment of the stay: the breakfast! In many travels and many places I've been, I never had a bigger and more delicious breakfast: ham and cheese, cereals, juice, yogurts, milk, different fruits, one of the best cappuccinos I've ever had (prepared by the owner herself) and on top of all, fresh home made cakes made by the mother of the owner, absolutely delicious! Can't think of a better way to start the day! The price is extremely good for what's offered, I'd say it is a bargain. It's a unique experience, I really felt like a king. It's particularly indicated for couples, but anybody can have a great time at Agriturismo Il Castello La Grancia. I can only highly reccomend the place, I will come back here for sure!",5
Hotel_Review-g644280-d1821178-Reviews-Agriturismi_Il_Castello_La_Grancia-Pienza_Tuscany.html,"This agriturismo is very nicely decorated and the gardens are perfectly kept. It's next to a castle along the Via Franchigena (ancient pilgrims route to Rome). It's only 10 minutes from Pienza and very conveniently located to visit the Val d'Orcia. Breakfast is fine, although fruit is missing. There's plenty of freshly baked cakes though... Wi-Fi is slow, but that's a good reason to enjoy the landscapes around instead of watching a phone or iPad ;-)",4

Nothing can replace the opportunity to sleep in a castle room, it's the most romantic experience a couple can have. All the sleeping rooms are connected by a dining room(completely furnished) available for guests in case they decide to prepare lunch or dinner by themselves. The location is fantastic, completed now by the new bio-lake that provide a totally different experience compared to a standard pool. Nearby the are many cultivated fields, at 5 minutes by car there is Pienza, one of the most beautiful villages in Italy, within 20 minutes by car many other famous places (Montalcino, Montepulciano, bagno Vignoni etc.). In order to enjoy the location and the opportunities of visiting good places is absolutely needed the car. The breakfast was fabulous, with a wide choice of handmade cakes, local cold cuts, vegetables and fruits from their garden (tomatoes were exceptional), when I have breakfast there I always jump the lunch... Cinzia is always kind and ready to satisfy all customer requests, obviously this is a family managed farmhouse, so the guests must accept to wait a little if everyone is busy... In short the location is fabulous, with many chances of visiting nearby places, the farmhouse is nice, clean, and , considering that is in special location(is not so easy to find a room in a castle), not expensive at all. I hope to have the opportunity to return to this place earlier than 5 years from now,",5
Hotel_Review-g644280-d1821178-Reviews-Agriturismi_Il_Castello_La_Grancia-Pienza_Tuscany.html,"I never realized how exciting a castle could be for 2 adults until we arrived at the hotel. We explored the grounds like little children. It was beautiful! The service was great. The lady who received us could not speak any English but was so friendly and tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible. It was very clean and comfortable. We appreciated the use of a kettle which is not standard issue in Italy. Nothing is broken or not working. One can see that great care is taken by the owners to keep everything functioning as well as pleasing to look at. We were left alone all the time to enjoy the accommodation and especially the stunning pool area which totally blew us away. I have never experienced a real bog garden pool. The water was crystal clear with even a special floor covering for entry into the pool so that you don't have to experience the slippery sides. After a hot day in the car, a quick dip in the pool was very much appreciated. The gardens looked amazing! The wifi worked well. Breakfast was good. Parking was spacious. It was a close drive to Pienza for an evening stroll through the quaint streets. We were surprised when we finished our meal at Sette Di Vino, that it was already 8.50pm. We were able to drive back to the Castle in beautiful light enjoying the scenery and even still taking photographs. This is definitely the prettiest part of Tuscany that we saw. What I call 'The 2 Famous Zig Zag Roads' are both within 15 minutes drive of this lovely establishment. Of course, I googled long and hard beforehand to find them and mark them on my GPS.

The only thing that I recomend is to see the map before u go there, my swedish gps couldnt find the addres.. it only took us to Pienza.. later we had to get a map, it was easy to get there but the gps system couldnt get the address, maybe becouse there is but concecction there or becouse it is a asmall road, ethier way... check it out before you get there.

Renato met us and picked us up from the nearby airport. He explained the layout of the town so we could get around. But first, he needed to take us to the “Guardia Medica,” a type of First Med medical care facility because my kid had just gotten sick (throat infection) before our flight to Lampedusa. After taking us there, he brought us to the pharmacy for us to fill the prescription for some anti-inflammatory medication they gave her, and offered to take my payment for the medical visit to the post office for processing. All this before stepping into his hotel, which is charming & beautiful. It’s spacious, comfortable, and he lent us a scooter to buzz around the island on. I hope there’s no need to explain the tranquility of the island and it’s fantastic beaches, or the fresh food, especially fish, or anything else. Just don’t make the mistake I did and spend more time here than you’re planning if you’re looking for a relaxing location. And stay by Renato’s little oasis in Lampedusa!",5

The hotel itself if wonderful, very bright, clean and cheerful with excellent rooms, pool and rooftop area which is excellent for relaxing with a book, catching the sun or even drying a swimsuit. Fantastic buffet breakfast as well. I also recommend the boat trip which is great fun - relaxing and with an amazing fresh Italian full course lunch served on board! Renato was a truly fantastic host with perfect English and deep knowledge of all things Lampedusa. There are very few non-Italian tourists on Lampedusa (part of its charm for foreigners!) and El Mosaico is THE place to stay if you're Italian is a little rusty.

Taking the first steps into the hotel, you can immediately feel that this is Renato's true passion. The details throughout the hotel are perfection: built-in couches positioned to maximize views, hand-painted tiles, playful artwork that reflects the owner and the island, gorgeous woodwork accenting the walls and ceilings, and a yellow hue that really calibrates you to the sunny and happy disposition of Renato and the staff. It couldn't be more perfect. The rooms are a very generous size, again, beautifully appointed with artisan details and perfect craftsmanship. The hotel location is perfect as you can walk to the town center, and the complimentary scooter is awesome! The scooter is definitely necessary in order to get to and from some of the island's main attractions, not the least of which is Rabbit Beach.

The water and soft drinks are refilled every day with out any additional cost! Bed is a king sized bed and 2 adults + 2 babies can fit in. If you need one, Renato can prepare a baby cot too. In a bath room there is only a shower and not a tub (Renato told me he doesn't have any room with a bath tub). Staff: Renato is the best! He is perfect as a host, owner, and also as a person too. He can speak English, which was very helpful too as many people in Lampedusa seems to have a difficulty in speaking English and it's some times a little bit hard to communicate as my Italian isn't good.... He is very helpful in many ways; free pickup/drop off not only from/to airport but to Rabbit Beach and other areas of island as well, very informative and good recommendation of a restaurant, where we can buy a swimming wear, when to go to beach, from which point we can have a fantastic view of ocean, etc...",5

We can't find enough positive things to say about this hotel. Renato runs the hotel perfectly, and all of the staff - the woman who runs the breakfast, the secretary, room cleaners, everyone - are both friendly and helpful. The service is in short some of the best we've seen. The rooms (more like mini-apartments) are kept spotlessly clean. Renato actually called us in Palermo the morning of our arrival to see if he could meet us at the airport (which he did.) He also quickly (2 minutes) arranged a car for us. The location is near the port, and close enough to Via Roma (the main drag) yet far enough away to be less noisy. Some rooms are near a busy traffic street, but as one of the Italian reviewers notes, the double-glazed windows solve any issues with this. The pool is a nice amenity after a hot day at the beach. The room decor is very bright and pleasant. In short, the goal of everyone at El Mosaico is to make your stay as pleasant as possible, and they succeed. We would recommend this hotel to friends without hesitation and will certainly be back.",5

The hotel is situated more or less at the harbour, 50 meter to the mini beach. The bay houses quite a few fishing boats. The inside of the hotel has a middle eastern feel to it. The lobby is spacious and lots of places to sit and relax. The pool is clean and comfortable. The room is great for Italian standards. A good bed which has a mosquito net around it is inside a concrete frame. It also has a small kitchenette, kitchen table and couch. The bathroom is small and the shower is very small, about 1 meter by 1 meter. It has good waterpressure so that makes up for the small space. Breakfast was simple and not much to choose from.

The staff was very nice and friendly when I checked in, and they found a room for me at 1 instead of the regular 4pm check-in time (late!). The GPS took me through a crazy gravel road where my car went into a crazy skid and I actually had to find another way up the hill to get to it. The Avenida Pioneros is the way to go so make sure the GPS is not taking you any other way. The hotel is nice, clean and the rooms are large. I had a 3 bedroom room and was okay, though I was missing glasses to drink, lotion or tissue paper. Very basic. My room overlooked the back and was a first floor so it was a bit dark and noisy by the elevators (bring ear plugs). The main issue is the internet. The Wi-Fi comes one and off and a regular photo by text can literally take about 2-3 minutes to download. Forget about doing more than a few texts and with patient, may be check Google maps. My cell only managed to get 1 bar so don't expect you can rely on your own internet either. Major issue for me if you ask me. The breakfast was simple but good, with a few types of pastries, canned and fresh fruits and coffee/tea. There was also scrambled eggs but they were very watery and I didn't try them.

Our room was spacious and everything worked as it should. It is not luxurious, but it does the job. The ambience, the facilities and the inclusive breakfast were similar to what we would expect from a 3 star hotel on the coast in the UK. The view of the Lake from the hotel itself (and from the 'Superior' rooms) is first class, and the grounds are attractive, albeit steep and not that easy to walk around. Breakfast is adequate. The evening meal is a buffet which looked as it would offer good value, but my wife and I chose to eat at the restaurant at the sister hotel, the Bustillo, down the steep drive where the food and service were excellent - so good in fact that we ate there all three nights of our stay. The drawback of the hotel is that it takes about 40 minutes to walk to the town centre and the volume of traffic makes this an unpleasant experience. So when you want to explore Bariloche then you probably need to call a taxi, which is OK but we prefer to walk. Be aware that the swimming pool does not open until 3pm each day, which seems a little odd.",4

This said, our experience of the restaurant was very, very slow service but to be fair the meal was good. Our room was classified as superior with view over the lake that was nice. Room was comfortable enough and clean Breakfasts were not the best we experienced in Argentina but served a purpose. We would certainly not use this hotel again, particularly as there seemed to be better options available eg Hotel Bustillo within the same overall complex and elsewhere near the town.

The swimming pool, however, was not open until 3 pm every day which ruled it out for us as afternoons and evenings were taken up with sightseeing and enjoying the restaurants in Bariloche town. The hotel restaurant only provided a buffet meal in the evenings and having experienced eating there at breakfast ( which was like a site canteena with closely packed tables and no table cloths) we decided not to avail ourselves of this amenity Also there is no bar in which to relax after those long days of sightseeing. Some of the staff on reception showed little interest in providing any a quality service and on our departure offered no help with our luggage despite the lift being out of order! The access road comprises a steep dirt track which is unsuitable for walking on except in walking boots. There is, however, another hotel on this complex namely hotel Bustillo which is some 350 metres down the aforementioned dirt track. This does have a swimming pool that is open in the mornings, a bar in which to relax and breakfast and evening restaurants with table cloths.We did take a evening meal in the restaurant which was satisfactory and used the bar on a number of occasions but this did involve trekking down the dirt track or getting lifts in the hotel transport which was equally dirty. Thus, if you are tempted to try the Villa Huinid group I would strongly recommend you chose Hotel Bustillo although suggest there are much better value options available in the Bariloche area to enjoy the magic scenery. .",2

We were in the upper , cheaper motel-type accommodation, and had to ask for a shuttle to the main hotel, just 500m away , but it was down a very steep, windy, dirty and dusty track. There was no shuttle to and from the town, very disappointing. We were told we could easily get taxis, at a cost of around 100peso. Though for anything there seemed a long wait time. We ate evening meal and lunch the next day at the hotels bar restaurant, only place open. No a wide range of options, but light fare. The breakfast was basic. Toast was already pre add and cold. They had forgotten to turn on the hot water urn for teas. Orange juice, like coloured water. Felt like a cheap USA motel breakfast. A redeeming feature was the view from our room of the lake. And in room 1200 our bathroom had an outside window , so we were able to have a through draft at night, even then it was very hot., no fan or air conditioning. They just had a vending machine for water bottles or soft drinks. I asked about any nearby shops to buy water or snacks, and was told they were too far away, and into Bariloche. I walked down to the main road, and went in the opposite direction and came across a lovely bakery, that sold basic items. So I bought our 2 litre bottle of water at 60pence, rather than £4 in the hotel vending machine.",3
Hotel_Review-g312848-d4173038-Reviews-Villa_Huinid_Hotel_Pioneros-San_Carlos_de_Bariloche_Province_of_Rio_Negro_Patagonia.html,"The hotel consists of three sites located on a steep hillside. The lower section are Lodges, the middle level building contains rooms as well as the bar and the main restaurant, the upper building, Villa Pioneros, was where we stayed. This section is very modern and the views from the front of the Andes are spectacular. Our room was not air-conditioned and even with the window open the room remained a bit too hot even when the outside temperature was below 14C. Breakfast was taken in this hotel and was satisfactory but dinner was only available at the middle site from 8pm till midnight and was excellent. However, the biggest disadvantage we found was the roadway on the site between the buildings and access to the main roads above and below the hotel. They were not made up and deeply rutted. They were very difficult to walk on and even though there was an internal shuttle bus the journey between buildings was very uncomfortable. The walk into Bariloche itself was along the main roads without footpaths. If you like good walks from your hotel we cannot really recommend this one.",3

What we didn't realise was that to get to the main road you had to walk a stony bumpy road with no path. This was made worse if the sprinklers had been on and then it was muddy. There was a mini bus service from the hotel to the bar which was the next building down. We went to the bar but on one occasion we had to ask if it was open as there was no one serving, it was open but we had to wait. Our room was said to be superior, what a joke. There was no fridge or mini bar with just one wardrobe and we had to stack the cases up on the side as there was just no room. The room was very small. We could see the lake but would have preferred more space and more than five coat hangers. The breakfast was not as good as other hotels that we had stayed in our trip to South America. The bathroom door didn't even close but if fairness this was rectified after we had mentioned it. It's a pity more thought hadn't gone into looking after people without cars",2

This place is where things began to go downhill. The rooms here are AWFUL. Not worth the money saved.

For a three stars hotel it´s really new, comfortable and clean. All the staff is nice and polite. I didn´t have any problems. I only suggest that the housekeeper could set up the clothes in the room, in order to be better arranged. However, the cleaness is great. The restaurant in Pioneiros is only for breakfast, but they have a van that takes you to have your meals, if you decide to do them at the hotel, to Villa Huinid Bustillo. I really liked it. I stayed in a room to the lake, so the view was outstanding! It´s near the downtown city and they call the remis (taxi) when it´s necessary. I recommend it.",4

A place that definitely worth the visit. UPS 1) The view (looking to a fantastic lake/mountains) be sure to ask for the front rooms. 2) The Staff is fantastic… 3) Breakfast is delicious (ask for the pear and the marmalade). DOWNS 1) Distance from the center. 2) Lacks a restaurant, if you need midnight snacks like I do. Let me explain this one a little better. The Villa Huinid Complex has three different hotels/cabañas the one in the middle (Villa Huinid Bustillo has a restaurant and a fee 0f 30% if you what things to be delivered to Pioneros, so if you need room service it will cost you time and an extra)",4

Lobby is nice for a 3 starts hotel. Price is very good compared to the area/stars/comparable facilities. Breakfast was included in my case and was good in quality and in quantity compared to similar. Rooms are good in space. Beds and pillows are comfortable. Restroom is also good. Very good lighting and electric plugs available which is very rare and necessary for all the gadgets we need to charge. Also a great value for the room is the view…you can see the lake from your window. It has a warm water pool and a Jacuzzi next to the pool. Good and open wifi connection. Service is average. Downsides: 1) Check in time is 4 pm and Check out is 10 am !!!!...amazing…!!!...2) There is no restaurant in the hotel building and this can be a big problem sometimes if you get tire to the hotel and you need to go back to the city to eat (you need to take a taxi for about 40-55 pesos). There is another hotel (5 starts) that belongs to the same owner and they tell you that you can go there but of course a 5 starts price. Also they give you info for a delivry restaurant but in our case, we waited up to 8 pm which was supposed to be the opening time and then, uppss…they never picked up the phone.

We arrived early and were able to utilise the luggage storage and use the Hotel facilities immediately. We enquired about late check out as our plane was late the following evening, and as no one else had booked the suite, we were given an extra hour without charge, and were able to continue to use the pool until we left at 8.00 pm. The Suite was just as the pictures on the booking.com website through whom we booked. Our son loved his individually styled bed, and we liked the little balcony which overlooked the pool. There was a separate toilet to the nicely appointed bathroom with overhead shower, complete with a selection of toiletries; shampoos, hair net, manicure set, ear cleaners, and body cream. The only negative is that there are no tea and coffee making facilities. We loved the pool area, and particularly the Jacuzzi. We didn't have a problem in getting sunbeds either. Hot/Cold drinks can be obtained from the reception area, with a couple of choices of chocolate bar (no mini bar in room, bottled water provided only). Cocktails can be provided by reception until it closes at 10.30 pm. A pass-code for the back and front entrance are given should you be out partying later than that! The town is only 10 mins walk from the hotel. (Turn left out of the Hotel, walk to the underpass and turn left and keep going past the church - you won't miss it!). There is a park 5 minutes from the Hotel (turn right and walk the beach path) and a beach bar 2 minutes further along. There is a hotel instructions manual written in both French and English, and you are handed an Ile De Rey guide book when given your room key. We booked the 13 euro breakfast, but I wouldn't again and would have the 8 euro continental. The restaurant, attached to the Hotel (where breakfast is served) is a delight for afternoon and evening dining. We enjoyed some fantastic food and would highly recommend including the service. We chose the three course meal for £28 euros each, and felt it was fantastic value. The beach is excellent. Beautiful golden sand, which my son and I walked along up to and opposite the little lighthouse. Plenty of rock pools up at that end of the beach when the tide goes out, and we saw quite a few families with buckets collecting. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to travellers wanting a relaxing stay, or as a base with a car to tour the island. The staff are wonderfully accommodating and ready to help with any request or queries.",4

And it did! We were given a family room looking out onto the swimming pool. The room had two bedrooms, one double and one twin, a toilet and a bathroom, nothing too amazing but it was clean and hospitable. We had a nice terrace with a table which looked out onto the lovely pool area. The pool looked very welcoming, but it was the wrong time of year for a dip as we would've frozen! There was also a spa pool which was warm, so that could be used. The pool area was very nice with plenty of sun beds and was actually a great place to chill out. The hotel is also opposite an amazing beach area... Truly beautiful. There's also a beach bar where you can eat and have a few cocktails. The hotel is based on the island outside of La Rochelle and its a beautiful place to be, there are many old French villages, plenty of places to eat and gorgeous beaches.

Instead we drove to it and booked. Then the price was 10€ more expensive. No problem we took it and asked if we could park our car inside. That would have costed €10, so mentioned the online price and got the parking for free. However, the receptionist realised that there was no space anymore. She promised to inform us when a place became available. That didn't happen though. Only before going to bed and asking again suddenly a place was available... The room with view on the parking was the cheapest. Glad we took it, because the pool view was almost double the price. You would have to accept guests walking in front of your terrace... That room is ok, seperate toilet and bathroom. Safe with a too easie to guess code as it contains the room number and it can't be modified... There is a bar but is only open during the restaurant hours. A bit pointless... About the restaurant read my seperate review. When checking out another person was at the reception, so I feared that the parking fee would be added in addition to the cost of the lamp that was distroyed in our room. Neither were charged.

After sneaking round minor roads we arrived in time for our booked lunch but our relations from la palmyre were over 2 hours late and the chef had gone home by the time they arrived! Anyway the food and service was very nice and there is a nice view towards La Rochelle and on our day the crawling traffic in front of the hotel. The special menu was good value and had lobster which was well cooked in spite of the unnecessary filo parcel.

We stayed here a week at an extortionate cost, although it is still cheap for the island generally. There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room and a small breakfast needs to be arranged the day before for a ridiculous price. The restaurant is also overpriced for the area. A short walk round the corner offers a wealth of good well priced restaurants for half the price. These include Le RéGalet, Le Platin, Pizza Re, La Plage and so on. The pool is unheated, freezing cold and positioned on the roadside. Not very appealing. We had the smallest balcony in the world, in a dark, corner located room for us and our 5 year old son. The balcony was so small you couldn't sit down. Pointless. It faced a back alley. As we were staying there after a week spent at my father's house near Aulnay, we had our own towels and a few smalls that needed rinsing through - especially after beach or pool days. We put these out to dry on the balcony. We were immediately shouted at by the neighbouring house whose back garden looked up at the hotel. Firstly a woman was screeching something at us in French about the balcony looking like a campsite. Then a man later shouted up to us to take our wet clothes and towels down. We refused. Its a balcony! Facing a back street alley and we had no where else to hang our stuff. The next day the hotel informed us they had a complaint about our wet towels offending the neighbouring house and to remove them immediately. I told the staff that in all my years of staying in hotels I had never been told that i can't use the balcony to hang out wet things. They just shrugged and said we could use the hotel's tumble dryer. (They dont offer a laundry service). Quite appalling and ridiculous. On our last night we were kept awake for hours by some couple having a very,very loud argument on the floor below us,. Not a great atmosphere for kids. Some of the reception staff are personable. There are no proper facilities. The 'shop' is a chiller in reception. No better than a vending machine. There's no bar, no snacks available and a limited staffed reception for just a few hours a day. The parking at 10 euros a day is bonkers. Use the car park on the beach opposite - it's free! And as for the Wifi. Forget it! It's sporadic and slow. There is also no lift to the first floor which means you have to drag all your luggage up and down two flights of stairs. Don't stay here if you have a mobility issue. I've given this hotel 3 stars because it was on the whole clean and convenient and enabled us to stay on a beautiful, if somewhat overpriced island. But the facilities are very, very basic. For the same price we could have had a luxury five star, all inclusive experience in Spain, Greece or Turkey etc. Which is what we will be doing next year!",3

The bed was comfy although it was two singles joined. The room had all your basics and air con which was nice.

Our room was clean and tidy and the hotel staff were friendly, helpful and very forgiving of our lack of french. They kindly met us at the bus knowong we were getting in late from San Senastian and were most apologetic over a mix up over room cleaning thar was largely my fault! We enjoyed a meal in the reasurant and found the breakfeast to be reasonable value on an Island renowned to be on the expensive side - its not unusual to be charged 4eu for a tea which is half the price of the continental breakfeast which comprises great fresh fruit, cereal, yoghurt, pasties bread, tea, coffee, jam and a warm greeting. Our top floor room had a good view. On the downside the internet was very very slow - speak up about this as the hotel obviously configures it for functions and were able to improve it after we mentioned it. Ile de Re is a great place for riding and the bikes from the hotel were reasonable at a reasonable price, though their range is limited. I am 6ft and needed to rent one from the local shops, but there are three within easy walk. Get out and head to the furthest reach of your ride along the island early as the sea breeze usually (not always!) provides assistance on the trip back toward the hotel and is a pain to ride into. Its a shame there are no fridges in rooms as we like to buy and use local market foods while riding - hit the Le Flotte Market - good local produce and lots of characters.",4

Great welcome, secure parking, easy to find location, good basic rooms, nice pool and short hop to a stunning beach. 3-4 nice restaurants nearby that are much greater value than the hotels restaurant (although the hotel restaurant is of a higher standard and thus the price.) Do pay a visit to Le Platin (5-10min walk); nice down to earth restaurant with the best (and biggest) serving of Moules I have had. Waiter is also a great character and very friendly - liked it so much we went back for a second night. We also used 'Fred the Boulangerie' for coffee and pain au raisin at breakfast; great value, fab coffee and great pastries. Il De Re is a great relaxing place at this time of year (mid sept).

Nevertheless the rooms were adequate and clean and although there was some manoeuvring to be done to get into the toilet and shut the door this was not a problem. Our room overlooked the pool on the ground floor and although at first I was concerned about privacy and noise, these proved to be groundless and the pool being open until 10pm meant you could swim basically whenever you wanted.

It had received positive ratings and we were looking forward to being near the beach and enjoying a sea view room. Our first (non hotel related) unpleasant surprise was that the bus service from La Rochelle train station to Ile de Re only runs every 3-4 hours on Sundays and holidays. Not wanting to spend a few hours waiting for the next bus we took a taxi for about 40 euros for the 20 minute trip. The hotel is located in the first village after crossing the bridge. The hotel faces a main road and to the left of the beach is a rather industrial view of the port of La Rochelle. The lady at the front desk was quite friendly and we were able to check in at 13:00 instead of 15:00 since our room was ready. She took us to room 111 on the ground floor. Unfortunately it was rather dark and facing the parking lot on the rear. There was also a strong ammonia smell in the bathroom. We opened the windows to air out the room and then left to pick up our rental bikes. (The hotel also rents bikes, bur we'd already reserved at another shop.) We realized that the hotel is rather far from the center of the village (15-20 min walk) and there really isn't too much to see in Rivedoux anyway. We much preferred La Flotte and St Martin-de-Re. On our return we were able to access the rear entrance/ parking (10 € per night if you come by car) with the security code provided at check-in. Since there are no other restaurants nearby we decided to try the hotel restaurant and we enjoyed a really nice meal of oysters and fish of the day. Service was friendly and we only found the house wine rather bland (splurge for a better wine) and the dessert overpriced (9.50€ for a simple creme brulee). It was the best meal amongst three restaurants we tried and I'd give the restaurant a 4 out of 5. Otherwise the room was clean and relatively spacious. We could hear the occupants in the room above ours, tv and free wifi worked trouble free. The bathroom was ok except for the ammonia smell, with a bathtub and plenty of hot water. Overall we had a trouble free stay, but were disappointed by the view and location for the price we paid.",3

But it was still everything we needed, with a nice and spacious bathroom to boot. The pool and hottub are opened until 22:00, so you can almost always take a swim when you get back to the hotel. Or you can hop on over to the beach, which is right in front of the hotel. For us, the best part about this hotel was the restaurant: breakfast was okay but not super special, but the evening dinners were really enjoyable, to such an extent that we almost didn't want to leave. The best was the starter that consisted of cod gratiné with Reblochon. Even if you're not staying in this hotel, try and visit the restaurant.

We would have been disappointed had we paid the normal rate as the hotel is wedged into a small residential site. We also avoided the over-priced breakfast.

We arrived after midnight and so had to wait till morning to speak to the management. We wanted to be moved to another room or to leave the hotel. We had several discussions with them but while they said they understood our complaints, they weren't prepared to do anything about it and as we had booked for two nights we would be charged for this irrespective of whether we stayed or left.

We left after the second night due to 1. The hotel is on a very busy road and we couldn't sleep at night as we felt as if we were on the M25 2. The double bed was very small. 3. The restaurant was average but expensive. 4. The view over the Atlantic takes in the heavy industrial area of la Rochelle. 5. The balcony was so cramped that only one of us could use it at a time. I was offered a change of room for the second night but no refund on the supplement that I had paid for this magnificent sea view. As we had booked via an agency we lost our money for the third night but I was willing to do that just to move out of this hotel. In the end the receptionist said that she would give me a gift of a free night's accommodation at another time. That must have been a joke.

This is without a doubt the best located hotel in the area, right on the sandy beach, but also has an excellent pool, which is great as the beach can be a little too windy at times. There are dozens of really good restaurants within a few minutes stroll but as we did last year, opted for the half board option which represents good value. Breakfast was traditional European fare, hams, fruit, toast etc but was plentiful and the coffee is excellent. Although a relaxed atmosphere, the dining room (at breakfast) can get a little chaotic when busy. Nobody speaks much English and consequently some things ordered with the waiting staff can get lost in translation, although we often found this humorous. Special thanks to Alfonso, Jose and the rest of the restaurant staff for their hard work. A previous review mentioned the parking at the back of the hotel, the sand there is deceptively deep and it became my entertainment for the day seeing a car being pushed or pulled out after becoming stuck! Parking in the town is awful, I found a car par at the back of town for 2 Euro’s a day and was an 8 minute walk away. Our sea view room was on the top floor with a large balcony where we sat each evening watching the spectacular sunsets over Trafalgar whilst sipping a cold beer. Our room wasn’t big but it was comfortable and more that adequate with a large flat screen TV, not that I watched it much, but was nice to watch a Real Madrid and Barcelona game and keep up with the Olympics. There was a mini bar and air conditioning which took a while to get to grips with. No room safe so valuables were kept at reception which is slightly irritating.

There are plenty of good restaurants within a five minute stroll but we thought the food at the hotel was pretty good as well (although the breakfast buffet options are a little limited - at least, it felt that way after seven nights). We must compliment the restaurant staff - they were absolutely brilliant with our two year old. And the cleaning staff do a pretty decent job as well, given the size of the hotel and its rather complex layout. A word of warning about parking: be careful about parking around the side of the hotel, as the sand there is deceptively deep and every day at least one car had to be pushed or pulled out after becoming stuck! Don't expect luxury - it's a three star hotel, after all, but if you are going to visit Zahara you are unlikely to spend much time in your room.",3
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"We chose this from the internet as a last night stay in Spain on the way back to Gibraltar. What an inspired choice. The hotel is excellent, with great sea view rooms in a separate but easily accessible block (with excellent public rooms and a good pool area). Whilst the main hotel is nice I would definitely recommend the new block. It is literally a 30 second walk to the boardwalk that takes you to the town beach. The beach itself stretches for miles and has a shallow slope making it very safe for paddling or bathing, Reception staff are helpful and friendly and speak good English. We used the restaurant for breakfast and found that well supplied with a good range of continental and cooked food. Only problem is parking which is highlighted on the hotel's website. No onsite parking for the hotel itself and the town get crowded. There is however limited parking on the street outside the hotel and on the beach. Make sure you get there early!",5

We've also stayed at other hotels and apartments in Zahara but I would always consider the Gran Sol to be the best. The proximity of the hotel (on the beach front and in the heart of the town) sets it apart from the rest and the relaxed nature of the staff make it an all round great stay. The staff are always the same and have a unique way about them - some on here commenting have stated rude but when you get to know them you realise they're actually very funny people Just with a slightly different sense of humour to that back in England. They all speak a few words of English but the fact that you have to make the effort to speak Spanish makes you realise that this is a real Spanish town and not a purpose built British holiday enclave like on a lot of the other costas. The rooms are always very clean, as is whole hotel, with some having amazing balconies over the sea front.",5

It was raining really heavy and we were soaking wet.

We tried their house speciality and the resorts, various tuna dishes. The tuna sashimi I had was the worst I have ever eaten, it was severed with some poor imitation of wasabi, also disgusting.

We couldn't have been happier with the locaton... set directly on the beach and with the majority of bars and restaurant within a 5 minute walk. We had booked a room with a lateral seaview as this was the last room available for that weekend. Reading other comments about the rooms I think our room had been renovated as it was fresh, bright, airy and modern with access via a key card. We saw other guests with regular keys rather than key card. We had a private terrace that could not be overlooked and a pretty good seaview. The girl on reception was very friendly and helpful but a shame we cannot say the same about the restaurant/bar staff. Breakfast was included and was ok but nothing special.... the service is a bit chaotic with guests and staff bumping into each other as the service area is not very big. Wifi is available in the reception and bar area although it was quite slow.

Expensive, but with poorly prepared food and rather haughty service. Our least popular venue in the entire area to date. One to avoid",2
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"Stayed for nine nights in August and had a really relaxing time, so much so that we cancelled a few days in Seville at the end of our holiday to stay in Zahara de los Atunes. Everyone knows the hotel , it's alandmark in the town because of it’s envious location, right on the beach and just a stones throw from all the bars and restaurants. We arrived mid afternoon to be greeted at reception by the very lovely Patricia, who was the only English speaking person at the hotel, apparently we were the only English guests, but we liked that. I asked if it was possible to get a sea view room but apparently the hotel was full. Our room was very spacious with high ceilings and an exceptionally comfortable bed, a bit dated though. It had a large flat screen TV but with only one English (news) channel, but we hadn’t come to watch TV. The room was cleaned daily and met all of our needs. My only gripe would be that there was no in room safe, so I had to keep my valuables in the safe at reception, it wasn’t a problem but would have been more convenient. The shower head didn’t fix properly to the wall so it had to be carefully placed under an arm or between the legs whilst washing, again not a big deal but it would have been more convenient. We were in room 219 which is on the side of the hotel directly above a busy bar and restaurant, it was pretty loud until around 2am, this was the only thing that spoiled our stay, our sleep quality was poor. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful with excellent coffee, (don’t expect a full English) the communal areas are nice and the pool clean, tidy and under used probably because the beach is so nice. We had initially booked room only but upgraded to half board for what I thought was a small sum so that if it wasn’t great (as some hotels can be) we’d simply eat out at one of the scores of lovely restaurants near by, however we were very surprised at how good the food was especially as the tables were laid out so lovely with nice cutlery and proper linen napkins (That’s how I judge a restaurant) The service was prompt and respectful, I know a previous contributor was upset by the waiters attitude but nobody spoke any English and I think some things could get lost in translation. Parking can be a problem as the entrance to the beach is right by the hotel, we were unbelievably lucky and parked directly out side the hotel for free but there are several nearby car parks for only 2 euro’s a day. I have been all over Spain but for me, Zahara de los Atunes was the nicest place I’d been to, it was so chilled, relaxing and unspoilt, I never saw one football shirt or ipad, it was like stepping back in time, didn’t even see too many mobile phones, I would go back tomorrow at the drop of a hat and despite it’s small failures I’d stay in a quieter room at The Gran Sol Hotel.",4

Very relaxing. Affordable parking options either on beach or through hotel. Prices fluctuate by season. They are a bit expensive for a 3 star hotel, but they were pretty filled up. There are more affordable options not on the beach, so you are paying a premium for the location. Sea view rooms run about 20 to 25% more than other rooms at the hotel. The public beach in front is beautiful & well maintained with a very active lifeguard staff. There is a strong current on this beach so use caution when swimming. Lots of waves. It is more for wading or surfing than swimming. The town has many great restaurants & live performances are often scheduled at the venue across the street from the hotel.",4

Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 days in July as part of a touring holiday in Andalucía. The biggest positive about this hotel is its location, literally on the beach and walking distance to the nice bars and restaurants in the town. The rooms are a good size, a little dated, but clean, air conditioned and the beds comfy. No complaints for a 3 star hotel at this price. The lack of in room wifi is slightly dull - the only place it works is in reception. However the reason I would not return to this hotel or recommend it to anyone was the attitude of the staff. On arrival and checking in, we went to our room (a superior with sea view) to find that my request for a room with a double bed not twin beds had been ignored or missed. I went back to reception with my booking information on which I had specifically requested a double and was told that there was nothing he could do as the hotel was full. I pointed out that I had booked in February, that the request for a double had been acknowledged, and also that it was my girlfriends 30th birthday that day and the guy couldn't have acted like he cared less if he tried. He literally just shrugged his shoulders and then turned away started typing on this computer like the conversation was over! I asked if I could speak to the manager and he told me that the manager wasn't available but if I came back and saw him tomorrow lunchtime he might be able to move us to a different room but couldn't make any promises. I declined as spending the first morning of my stay hanging round until lunchtime on the off chance he could move us didn't seem that appealing. This kind of attitude towards the guests appeared to be the norm across most of the staff. The bar was quite pleasant with a nice view down to the beach but the staff were unfriendly, never came to your table to ask if you wanted a drink and when you went up to the bar to ask for one often cleaning glasses appeared to be more of a priority than taking customer's drinks orders. I also made the mistake to ask about where to park my car. After being told that the hotel doesn't have a car-park (which I did already know - I can read), I asked if they could recommend somewhere to park. I was told they could not. I said that I had parked in the beach car-park (close by and only 2 euros a day) and did they think that would be ok for the 4 days or was there somewhere better - I got the same shrug I got when I mentioned there was a problem with my room. I still gave this hotel 3 out 5 as the location is so good it compensates somewhat for the bad service but if I was returning to Zahara, I would look hard for a different hotel.",3

This hotel built in 1989 has the best location and we booked it having visited the town on other occasions. We chose the sea view which had a premium but worth paying and booked half board as it was low season in Zahara so were not sure how many other restaurants and eateries would be open. The room facing the sea was lovely with a roomy terrace to sit out on and watch the sun set. There were slight spanish drains problems and there was no wifi access in the rooms which feels like an obligatory service these days for kids with tablets. The staff are a highlight of this establishment coming from an old school service and polite style of interaction. Their english was poor but that didn't really effect their ability to get us great food and service. A lovely swimming pool that could have been heated, but overall you can't beat the on beach location - one of our family favourites.",4

Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,We stayed at the Gran Sol last week for three nights. Zahara is a fantastic resort - its much busier than it used to be and parking is now a challenge but its still has an unspoilt feel about it. We have been been coming to this family run Hotel for about 20 years now and remember it before it had the pool and side extension. We have stayed in rooms all around the hotel including the luxurious roof suite. This year we were delighted to get the room at the front of the hotel looking out onto the beach. It is good value for this fantastic location on one of the best beaches in this part of Spain. We can't comment on the food as there is so much choice in the wonderful beach bars and town restaurants that we did not eat there - the breakfast is fine. Rooms are clean and the staff are helpful. The only thing we would like to see is a fridge to keep out water chilled and better wi-fi - currently only available in the bar area but fast enough,4

Zahara is one of those nearly totally Spanish resorts which wont stay that way for too long as it is absolutely lovely and a total foodie place. It was our first time in Gran Sol which is in a totally enviable position. You walk out the front door and you are more or less on the beach and walk three minutes to the left and you are in the centre of town with all its lovely restaurants. Be warned that if you go out to eat at night around 8.30 - 9.00pm you will be on your own. 10.00pm seems to be the norm as its so Spanish. Back to the hotel - a bit tired perhaps, Didn't eat in except for one lunch which was fine. Breakfast was included but only went the first day as the scrambled eggs which I rate a hotel by were not very exciting so didn,t warrant a return trip for the next two days.

We booked a three night stay for later in the week and negotiated a good rate for half-board. The hotel is comfortable enough, glorious views from the balconies, room was clean and comfortable, the half-board was a mistake as the selection and quality of food was poor. What really irritated was the attitude of the staff and, particularly, of the duty manager. On the first evening in the hotel I slipped in the bath while having a shower, banged my ribs on the edge of the bath and was in considerable pain for the remainder of our stay. We reported my fall to the duty manager; he couldn't have cared less and other than having a non-slip mat put in the bath on the following morning ignored my plight totally. We asked for directions to the nearest doctor the following morning and he drew us a map which led us in totally the wrong direction! Fortunately, my wife speaks excellent Spanish so we were able to find our way despite his awful map! At no time in the three days did he ask if there was anything he or the hotel could do to help me and offered on discount by way of compensation for my pain; pain I would not have incurred if the hotel had provided a non-slip mat in the first place.

Cereal, yoghurts, toast, juice and the usual available. Didn't go hungry. The bathroom was a bit boring with dull dark blue tiles and didn't look very inviting, but spacious at least and not really a drawback in the greater scheme of things.

Lovely sunsets and I think I saw some restauranty bars along the beach which played music in the evening (not heard from hotel) There are tasty restaurants in the area in general. If you go left coming out of the hotel there are 2 restaurants on the left just down the road (we went to the end one) and sat sort of outside protected by a plastic anti-draught arrangement. There's also a yummy traditional pizzeria if you go left coming out of the hotel and then left again and cross the road. It has a wrought iron gate as a sort of door) I probably wouldn't stay more than 2 or 3 days in Zahara de los Atunes because it is a small place and once you've eaten out at a few places and been to the beach you've seen it all, but DO go. I had the best holiday of my life there! I think we chose the best hotel in terms of beach proximity, pleasant rooms, marble effect polished-looking interior especially upstairs hallways, nice overall finish on rooms, nice breakfast experience and good restaurants close by.",5
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"There is nothing wrong with the hotel - the rooms are a bit dated and I did think the bathroom could have been cleaner - glass tiles as a shower curtain were not clean - water stains and splashes ( not by us, but previous occupiers). Main gripe is the attitude - clearly the hotel's location will keep it filled but the staff /owners are CHARMLESS. Our electric went off for the first 3 nights of a 4 night stay - no lights or air con etc, no apology whatsoever, in fact they just shrugged their shoulders, after 3 nights they got someone to look at the air con and we moved rooms ( we had to move ourselves though!) and the rooms we were offered were of a poorer quality - we finally got a nicer room - but with twin beds instead of a double. We only had drinks at the hotel the waiters are surly and grumpy - they clearly do not enjoy their jobs and the bar prices are astronomical hence why we did not make a habit of drinking there. We chose the hotel as it had a pool, however the pool area was not kept too clean and the were a couple of cats who used the pool as drinking water. There is a pension just behind the hotel and the owner of that seemed lovely - good cafe as well- I wish we had stayed there instead - half the price and run by someone who wants to be hospitable. Not once did we get a welcome smile or casual 'hello' they are all grumpy as hell in Gran Sol hotel, very unusual for Spain.",2
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"We stayed in The Gran Sol for 12 nights and loved it. We had a frontal room with fabulous views. Our room was pleasant, the bed was quite big which was great, however there was no mini-bar, no safe & no drawers??. The air conditioning at it's lowest seems to be set but at a very pleasant temperature. Nice big balcony with a wonderful breeze at all times. The ladies who cleaned the rooms were very pleasant. Reception staff were dreadful & the waiters were not very friendly either. We only had breakfast 3 mornings & we found it ok. We had lunch in the hotel, again on 3 occasions & enjoyed that. We never had a dinner in the hotel so cannot comment on that. There was a problem with the pool while we were there & it had to be emptied & cleaned so we were without that for 3-4 days but with the beach on our doorstep that was hardly a problem. It is a very safe beach with 2 lifegaurd stations, ambulance etc... The pool area is so quiet it really is a little oasis. We've been to Zahara many times & love this little fishing village, behind the hotel are all the little restaurants & bars & the visitors are predominantly Spanish with the odd German thrown in. Definitely the most relaxing holiday we ever had, we just parked the car & forgot about it. Everything is in walking distance. The hotel is very clean, location second to none & we will definitely return.",3
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"Just back from a week in this hotel. Wisely chose rooms (3, for extended family) with sea views. This hotel's location is second to none - right on the sea front - and Zahara de los Atunes has long been a favourite for beach visits with my family. We live 1.5 hrs away and regularly visit this isolated fishing-village-cum-tourist-resort in the summer. But this is the first time we had stayed in one of its hotels. If the quality of a business is a reflection of its owner, the owner of this particular hotel - to be found in the hotel's cafe on most days - does not pay sufficient attention to detail. The design of Gran Sol is very good and there's no sense of claustrophobia - rooms, bathrooms, restaurant, cafe, pool area etc are all of decent dimensions. Here are some of the issues we noted: Toilet brush was filthy - hey, they only cost a euro each, so get a new one! Towels were too small Sheets on bed were too small Plants and flowers in pool area were unkempt Two cats frequented the pool area most of the time The sound of birds in the overgrowth on the balconies was constant rather than comforting - nothing against the birds, but cut back on the growth! Breakfasts included the cheapest kind of yogurts (the type that needn't be kept in a fridge). Same for the milk. Distinct lack of fruit options. Breakfast options the same every day. We didn't try an evening meal at this hotel Cleaning staff very friendly but perhaps not briefed on their full roles. For example, it appeared they never cleaned the bathrooms I tried for the advertised wireless connection and got 'local access' only ie no internet. The staff did practically nothing to help and I felt that it was 'my problem' The otherwise excellent pool table (I enjoyed a couple of games) swallowed my euro and the balls refused to come out. A member of staff, the owner in fact, returned my euro to me and suggested I speak to another member of staff who knew more about these things. When I did, he told me he didn't have the right key to open it up and look inside. So it didn't get fixed It seems like I have several gripes. More observations, really - we had quite a nice stay. This information may be of use to someone, which is why I post it. I think it will certainly be of more use to a potential customer than to the owner, who would likely have flown off the handle had I offered her my opinion. In the space of a couple of days, a troubleshooter could walk into this hotel, sort it all out at relatively low cost, and, probably, double the number of customers as a result. Judging from the way the two on-duty staff dealt with problems we had with paying at the end (taking turns to pass the buck - excuse the pun - to each other), an increase in clients is precisely not what the owners of Gran Sol desire.",2
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"After having seen the positive reviews we arrived at the hotel and, were told that there were no more beach/ocean view rooms. Fine we did just walk in but the room was in the middle of the building between the two wings right next to the lane dividing the two wings and, within arms reach of the pedestrian bridge. Tiny room, Tiny Bathroom and, the 80's vintage wall radio did not work nor did the broken balcony light, the balcony rail was rusted and, the shutters have seen better days. Needs a re-furb! The shower head was one of the handheld ones and, sprayed water everywhere, ‘read’ wet bathroom floor, there was a beday but it took up all the remaining bathroom space. Despite the brochure saying there was an in room safe NOT, and, apprently minibar NOT. No safe and, not even a little fridge, asked the middle aged gentleman at reception if there was another room alas there was not and, there were no safes or fridges in any room when I grabbed one of the brochures off the desk and, showed him it claiming there was, he shrugged his shoulders (maybe the brochures are from the 80's too). Good location though right on the beach and, next to the weekend markets in the old fort run by what seems a bunch of gypsies selling all sorts of morroccan influenced furniture, leather goods, jewellery (the leather, hemp kind that you wear after a sunny holiday) some food stalls and, of course clothes. They have some funny local t-shirts if you like that kind of thing too. You can walk for miles along the beach or go for tapas in the little squares all around the hotel. Loved Zahara but the Gran Sol could not provide us with exactly what we needed but for 89 Euro per night I can't really complain can I? Just Picky I guess. We had breakfast which was average pastries cereal etc. Left after the first night as the A/C made too much noise and, didn't really feel safe as the room backed onto the lane in the middle of the hotel when there was public access. Looks nice but check the room out first, might have just been the worst in the house so good luck.",2
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"We absolutely loved this hotel. We found it while driving away from the busy Costa Del Sol in October 2002 by chance and stayed 3 nights and expected to pay twice the amount that we paid for the room. Both the hotel and village was very quiet at that time and most of the guests seemed to be Germans. Our room was on the top floor with splendid a breathtaking view of the beach. We never had any meals in the hotel but local fish restaurants were fantastic. Recommended for the 35+, looking for a quiet, romantic holiday. Great value for money. Loved it.",5
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"A very nice hotel right on the beach in Zahara De Los Atunes. The hotel is mid sized and still has a local feeling. A few miles south are the large hotels, which have absolutely no charm in any way. This hotel is blissfully separated from those hotels by a few miles of undeveloped fields and sand dunes. The hotel is right in the town and you can walk out your door to the beach or walk around the beautiful small town with plenty of restuarants. I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a nice place to stay, on the beach, in the town, and still retain the feel of a real Spanish hotel. John",4
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"We stumbled upon this hotel while looking for an alternative to a not-so-nice place we'd booked for 4 nights at busy and dirty Los Canos de Meca. Zahara is a quietish seaside resort catering predominantly for Spanish tourists - it was nice not to be surrounded by English speakers. The hotel is a clean 3 star, with decent bathrooms and if you have a sea-facing room, you have a balcony which looks directly onto the sand. The beach is literally on your doorstep, and it's great for sunbathing and for long walks (or horserides if you're into that). The hotel pool area is lovely - protected from the wind and with lots of shade for protection from the scorching heat. The streets surrounding the hotel come alive at night - all the little fish restaurants spill out onto the pavements and there is a relaxed, yet buzzy atmosphere. The hotel breakfast is good - a buffet with fruit, cereal and different bread/toast options. Try olive oil on your toasted breadrolls instead of butter - Andalucian style! If youre looking for a beach holiday on the Costa de la Luz that is simple, quiet and doesn't require you to drive anywhere for anything, this hotel in Zahara is a good choice.",4
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"The hotel is in a beautiful position and I must confess that we had a lovely room facing the sea. I felt that the food was pretty dreadful. Breakfast was a disaster and dinner only marginally better. The dining room was always full of uncontrolled children running up and down screaming whilst their parents just looked on and smoked copious amounts of cigarettes and made endless phone calls on mobile phone to the annoyance of other guests. The receptionist at the hotel was a revolving role and when we arrived the man in that area was polite but very distant. The other man who took over was so unproffessional it was unbelievable. Every time one passed the reception area he buried his head. A further problem was the temparature of the wine in the dining room, it was far too warm. In conclusion I found that it was a family run hotel with a complete absence of any professional training.",2
Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,"We stayed at Hotel Gransol in Zahara de los Atunes for 3 nights at the end of May 2005. We asked for a double room 'dressed to the sea', so we had a fabulous view of the lovely long beach. Our room had double doors that opened on to a balcony with uninterrupted views of the beach. Our room was spacious and the decor was OK (a bit naff but not offensive), it was clean and airy. The hotel was nice & modern, the pool and garden were a little oasis. The restaurant was OK, we had an evening meal there, which was pretty average. Breakfast could have been improved on, a buffet with the basics, everything really packaged and poor quality selection of stuff. Staff were really pushed in the restaurant at all times (esp. if it was busy). Reception staff were pretty distant and not particularly knowledgeable about the area. The village itself is really popular with the Spaniards and there are some great little restaurants. We later discovered that past the original village (where Hotel Gransol is based) further along the road there has been massive development with holiday village upon holiday village and that's pretty awful but we were oblivious to this for days. Where the Hotel Gransol is located you are in the original settlement, in the mornings and evenings you can watch the local fisherman go out in their little boats which they launch from the beach. When they come back in everyone gathers round to observe their catch. The wind can pick up on the beach but we had great weather. Los Canos up the road has a gorgeous little beach too but has areas where there has been massive development too.",4

The only saving grace is that it’s not my own money! I asked for cleaning for which I was happy to pay, this didn’t happen.
